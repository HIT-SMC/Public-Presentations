# Introduction to the repository
* This is the lecture notes of the deep learning and reinfocement learning summer school 2019 ([DLRLSS2019](https://dlrlsummerschool.ca/)), held in University of Alberta, Canada, from July 24 to August 2. The video resources will later be published on [videolectures.net](http://videolectures.net/), where [former summer school videos](http://videolectures.net/DLRLsummerschool2018_toronto/) could also be found.<br>
* The whole summer school contains two parts: [deep learning](https://github.com/HIT-SMC/Public-Presentations/blob/master/DLRLSS2019/Deep%20Learning/readme.md) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/HIT-SMC/Public-Presentations/blob/master/DLRLSS2019/Reinforcement%20learning/readme.md), and also some [general thoughts about AI](https://github.com/HIT-SMC/Public-Presentations/blob/master/DLRLSS2019/General%20thoughts%20about%20AI/readme.md) from [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/yoshua-bengio/) and [Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/).
